# Objects & The Prototype Chain

## The Agenda 
What prototypes are

When prototypes might be used and how

How prototypes chain together and thus enable inheritance



## The Big Picture
Prototypes are a powerful way to organize, re-use, and express code.

In other words, we can build a lot of things with it.



## Glossary

**Function**
```markdown
*definition:* a set of statements.
*benefit:* it executes those statements. 
```

```javascript
//an example
```

**Object**
```markdown
*definition:* a map of properties, where each property has a name/key and a value.
*benefit:* it can store and represent things.
```

```javascript
//an example
```


**Instance**
```markdown
*definition:* a distinct object that was constructed
*benefit:* it is an individual object
```

```javascript
```

**this**
```markdown
*definition:* a keyword that is bound to an object when a function is envoked.
*benefit:* it enables contextual assignemnt. 
```

```javascript
	
```


**Constructor**
```markdown
*definition:* a function that gets called with new.
Conventionally capatalized.
*benefit:* it constructs and returns an object
```

```javascript
```
    
**Prototype**
```markdown
*definition:* is a property on a function. It points to an object.
*benefit:* it allows us to share methods across all instances of a function.
In other words, Those instances inherit properties from the prototype.  
```

```javascript
```
